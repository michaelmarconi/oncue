- Need a test to check that a job is picked up when an agent finally comes online, if one is not available when the job is enqueued.
- Need to allow agents to accept work destined for specific workers.
- Need to get rid of all textual component names in tests
- All messages should be serializable
- Clients should die when they can't connect to the server
- Improve job state recording
- Everywhere there is a Long(jobID), you need a null check!
- Since queue prioritisation happens in Java, any point treating Redis lists like queues?
- Should we send the type of agent along with the registration info?
